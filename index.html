                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Software and web development has always been an obsession of mine however growing up I often found it difficult to locate avenues to get involved and find peers who shared such a niche interest. For this reason, I felt discouraged from initially pursuing computer science in college opting instead for information systems. As intriguing as business was, the urge to delve deeper into advanced programming concepts led me to face the steep entry requirements for a computer science major.</p>

                    <h2>Technologies</h2>
                    <p>It’s not just a website, it’s an application. With the inception of next-generation web technologies, I believe the future of software will no longer be bound by platforms. As a full stack software developer, I seek out a wide range of technologies in an aim to develop powerful and scalable applications and services for the web. I believe technologies such as WebAssembly and Deno will challenge existing practices by making highly optimized software more dynamic and portable.</p>

                    <h2>Project: Personal Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>Brave web developers need no more than a sketch pad and an IDE. Behold the latest edition of my personal portfolio featuring a carefully crafted design, efficient content loading practices, and detailed site traffic analytics. The Fibonacci Sequence is incorporated into every aspect of the site’s visual design to create a UI that is both attractive and digestible while content optimizations and lazy image loading provide a responsive experience for visitors.</p>

                    <h2>Project: Private Messaging</h2>
                    <p>Completed in 2014 and written in PHP, this was one of the earliest web-development projects I had undertaken. Intended for those who do not trust data-selling companies with their private conversations this platform was designed to be a small-scale, privately hosted messaging platform to keep your messages out of corporate databases and behavior algorithms.</p>

                    <h2>Project: Roomate Portal</h2>
                    <p>A simple webapp for roommates to record, track, and reconcile general expenses and chores. When completed, this platform will allow users to form groups with their roommates and input expenses such as grocery purchases or log chores that have an agreed upon monetary value. Then calculates each member’s financial compensation to evenly distribute expenses.</p>
