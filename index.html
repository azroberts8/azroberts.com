          <div>Out There Events · Newark, DE · Jan 2025 - Present</div>
          <p>Out There Events is an early stage startup I'm building to redefine the future of event discovery and ticketing for occasions as small as meetups and happy hours, to .. as grand as festivals and sporting events. The vision: the Amazon of events, a marketplace connecting organizers with attendees while eliminating the excessive fees often associated with event ticketing. As the founder I have attended conferences as part of customer discovery as well as spearheaded the development of the platform using SolidJS and am currently assembling a team to take this project further.</p>

          <div>FNDRSNG · Newark, DE · Jun 2024 - Nov 2024</div>
          <p>At FNDRSNG, a software company dedicated to empowering small and mid-size nonprofits, I lead the development of a client configurable donation system - an opportunity that arose from my technical expertise and entrepreneurial drive being recognized by FNDRSNG's founder and former professor of mine. I architected and built a web application designed to seamlessly integrate with FNDRSNG's broader suite of solutions while minimizing transaction fees. Developed using the Deno Fresh Framework with Firebase as the backend, this platform prioritized resilience, architected such that every transaction was fully accounted for and recoverable in the event of an error to ensure client trust.</p>

          <h3>Embedded Firmware Engineer</h3>
          <div>Lutron Electronics · Austin, TX · Internship · May 2023 - Aug 2023</div>
          <p>As an embedded firmware engineer at Lutron Electronics, I developed a wireless firmware restoration tool for flashing Ketra devices to a pre-assembly state enhancing production flexibility. To achieve this I modified the firmware of a Silicon Labs based Ketra debugging device to support large data transfer over Openthread. I then developed a C# module that used the debugging device to transmit new firmware to the Ketra devices. Finally, I built a C# application that used the module to pair with Ketra devices and flash pre-assembly firmware along with device calibration data. I conducted over 1000 tests to ensure my solution was robust enough to reset hundreds of devices.</p>

          <p>As a software engineer I collaborated with a team to develop and deploy an Angular application utilizing Docker and Jenkins. In pursuit of optimizing business costs, I designed and built an Angular component to replace AG Grid, reducing annual licensing expenses by $80,000 while maintaining functionality and performance.</p>

        <p>Prehash Authentication introduces a reimagined security approach to password management that eliminates risks of weak or reused credentials without requiring users to change their habits. Unlike traditional password managers, Prehash Authentication does not store or transmit passwords instead generating a per-site cryptographic salt that is applied during authentication allowing users to user weaker or reused passwords without compromising their security. Even if an attacker gained access to your salts, they would still need your original password to reconstruct the site-specific hash. This concept was theorized and implemented as a Chrome extension by myself along with 3 innovative peers during the HenHacks 2025 24-hour hackathon.</p>

        <p>The JAN compiler is an academic project developed by myself along with 2 other engineers during my time at the University of Delaware. During this project we designed a minimal, strongly-typed programming language and built a language compiler entirely in TypeScript. Our compiler can build for WebAssembly and RISC-V assembly targets based on flags passed at compile time. To ensure reliability and integrity we wrote over 360 tests using the Vitest framework achieving 99% code coverage.</p>
